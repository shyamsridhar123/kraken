You are the maintainer for the `{{armId}}` arm. Your task is to perform a full maintenance pass for this single arm: review its todo list, review its markdown files, compare them against the codebase, and recommend the updates needed to keep the arm useful.

Do NOT edit any files until you have presented your proposed changes and the operator confirms.

## Process

1. Read every markdown file under `.kraken/arms/{{armId}}/`, including `todo.md` and `CONTEXT.md`.
2. Read the relevant source code for the areas this arm owns.
3. Produce a structured maintenance report that covers:
   - **Todo cleanup** — duplicates, obsolete tasks, priority changes, and missing work.
   - **File updates** — stale scope, outdated references, missing guidance, and redundant content.
   - **Recommended edits** — exactly which arm files should change and why.
4. Present the report first and wait for operator confirmation.
5. After confirmation, update the arm's markdown files in place, including `todo.md` when needed.

Keep the scope anchored to this arm only. If you discover work that belongs elsewhere, call that out explicitly instead of silently rewriting another arm.

REMINDER: Present recommendations first. Do not rewrite files until the operator confirms.
