# Runtime And API

Kraken runs as a local API with a local web UI on top.

## Runtime shape

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Browser[Browser UI] --> HTTP[HTTP routes]
  Browser --> WS[WebSocket terminal stream]
  HTTP --> Runtime[Terminal runtime]
  WS --> Runtime
  Runtime --> PTY[PTY sessions]
  Runtime --> Files["Project and global state"]
  Runtime --> Hooks[Claude hook ingestion]
```

## What the API does

- starts and restores terminal metadata
- serves the web UI when bundled assets are available
- manages PTY-backed terminal sessions
- creates worktrees for isolated terminals
- persists UI state and conversation state
- reads arm files and todo progress
- accepts hook events from Claude Code
- exposes channels for inter-agent messages

## Transport model

- HTTP for CRUD, metadata, and snapshots
- WebSocket for live terminal IO
- file-backed state for persistence

## Security defaults

- binds to `127.0.0.1` by default
- enforces loopback `Host` and `Origin` checks by default
- remote access must be enabled explicitly with `KRAKEN_ALLOW_REMOTE_ACCESS=1`

## Persistence model

- project-local scaffold lives under `.kraken/`
- runtime state lives under `~/.kraken/projects/<project-id>/state/`
- transcript events persist independently from PTY scrollback
- PTY sessions do not survive API restarts

## Main API groups

- terminals and snapshots
- command-deck arms and todo operations
- prompts
- channels
- code intel
- hook ingestion
- usage and telemetry
- monitor
- conversations
