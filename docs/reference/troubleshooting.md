# Troubleshooting

## `pnpm test` fails because of browser APIs

Make sure the workspace dependencies are installed from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Package resolution is broken

Run install from the repository root, not from a subpackage.

## Node version is too old

Use Node.js `22+`.

## Terminal startup fails

Check that your shell environment is available and executable.

## Worktree terminal creation fails

Verify:

- `git --version` works
- the workspace is a git repository
- the current user can create worktrees in `.kraken/worktrees/`

## GitHub summary is unavailable

Verify:

```bash
gh auth status
```

## Monitor refresh fails

Verify your X bearer token and API access.

## Messages disappear after restart

That is expected. Channel messages are in-memory only and do not persist across API restarts.

## A terminal survived reload but not server restart

That is also expected. PTY sessions can survive a reconnect window, but they do not survive an API restart.
